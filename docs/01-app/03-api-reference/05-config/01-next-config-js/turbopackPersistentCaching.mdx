description: Learn how to enable Persistent Caching for Turbopack builds
version: canary

## Usage

Turbopack Persistent Caching enables Turbopack to reduce work across `next dev` or `next build` commands. When enabled, Turbopack will save and restore data to the `.next` folder between builds, which can greatly speed up subsequent builds and dev sessions.

> **Warning:** Persistent Caching is still under development and is not yet stable. Users adopting should expect some stability issues.

> **Good to know**: Note that while `next dev` and `next build` can share cached data with each other, most cache entries are command-specific due to different configuration and environment variables.

```ts filename="next.config.ts" switcher
import type { NextConfig } from 'next'

const nextConfig: NextConfig = {
  experimental: {
    turbopackPersistentCaching: true,
  },
}

export default nextConfig
```

```js filename="next.config.js" switcher
/** @type {import('next').NextConfig} */
const nextConfig = {
  experimental: {
    turbopackPersistentCaching: true,
  },
}

module.exports = nextConfig
```
